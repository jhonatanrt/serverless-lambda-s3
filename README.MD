How to build a serverless 
===========

Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.

I use lambda, api gateway and s3. Also, I use `serverless` with three environments so You should create a env.yml in your project.
For example in env.yml

~~~javascript
dev:
    API_KEY: "YOUR DEVELOPMENT API KEY"
    API_SECRET: "YOUR DEVELOPMENT API SECRET"
~~~
